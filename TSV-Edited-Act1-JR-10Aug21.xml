                            <term>Thunder and lightning</term>: In early modern plays, the stage direction
                                "thunder and lightning" was very common, and the effects of thunder
                                and lightning produced in a variety of different ways. In this play,
                                it's assumed that the stage direction "thunder and lightning" is
                                directly linked to a storm (<ref target="#acd1999">Dessen and Thomson, 231</ref>). 
                                Making the sounds of thunder and lightning could have been achieved through
                                drums, flashes of fire, and fireworks. This type of effect was created
                                in the tiring house. They were noted by the bookkeeper in the manuscript
                                playbook used backstage so that he could cue for the effect at the right
                                time (<ref target="#lt1999">Thomson, 14</ref>). In many
                                other plays, the effects of thunder and lightning were linked to the
                                supernatural, and accompanied figures such as devils and witches,
                                who might ascend from a trapdoor that signified the underworld. An
                                audience would expect something supernatural when this particular
                                effect occured (<ref target="#lt1999">Thomson, 11</ref>).</note>

                                    <term>How she kicks and jerks</term>: It's important to
                                        remember that a performer in early modern plays could have
                                        expected to perform in a venue that was "a rectangular,
                                        flat, largely empty stage [with] no sets in the modern sense"
                                            (<ref target="#hss2015">Syme, 112</ref>). Thus, we can assume that there
                                        was not actually a physical ship on stage. Therefore, in
                                        order to portray some sort of sea voyage, the use of ropes,
                                        tackle boxes, and other sailing equipment could have aided
                                        the impression of being at sea, with characters pulling on
                                        cords found in the tiring house. The stage was
                                        seen as the deck, the tiring house as the cabin of the ship,
                                        and the balcony as the mast or the lookout area. During this
                                        play, it's also clear that the characters on the boat are
                                        fighting against strong waves; this illusion could have been
                                        made by the characters acting wild and hysterical

                                        The special effects used during live
                                        performances in early modern England would depend heavily on
                                        the budget of the playhouse; they could range from austere
                                        and simple to grand and elaborate (<ref target="#hss2015">Syme, 112-14</ref>). 
                                        Different effects such as drums, the firing of canons, and even
                                        fireworks could have been used to give the illusion that the
                                        actors and audience were actually in the center of a raging

                                        sin breeders" the shipmaster is referring to are women
                                        (here, specifically, Aminta, as she is the only woman on the
                                        boat). The shipmaster believes that everyone on the ship is
                                        going to die because they won't have any help from the
                                        heavens, and he blames this entirely on Aminta. Many times,
                                        women were denied passage on ships; if they happened to be
                                        on board, they were either a captive, a slave, or being
                                        forced to marry (<ref target="#gpm2019">Moore, 318</ref>). 
                                        In Aminta's next speech below, it becomes clear that she 
                                        has been captured by Albert, and that he has forced her to be 
                                        on his ship for his own pleasure. Ironically, Aminta is only on 
                                        the ship because of him, yet she is still being blamed for compromising 
                                        the ability of the men to control the boat during the dangerous storm.</note></l>

                                    <term>Oh, Monsieur ... to hate ye!</term>: In the 1647 text of the play, 
                                        question marks are used to punctuate "Oh ... redeem me" and 
                                        "How ... ye," but sometimes, in the seventeenth century, compositors
                                        would use question marks where we would use exclamation
                                        points today (<ref target="#mpj2007">Jackson, 549</ref>). 
                                        Thus, the lines (as presented here) illustrate Aminta's raging anger and
                                        hatred for Albert if the question marks are meant to be
                                        interpreted as exclamation points. Question marks in this
                                        scene give off a completely different meaning: they would
                                        account for Aminta's confusion as to whether she should
                                        curse and hate Albert. Regardless, one cannot be sure as to
                                        when Aminta exactly falls in love with Albert, but it's
                                        crucial to consider that she is his prisoner before their love blossoms.</note></l>

                                    <term>I am undone, sir.</term>: On board this ship, there is a very
                                        interesting mix of characters from various social classes.
                                        Three of the men—Lamure, Franville, and Morillat—are French
                                        lords. In the early modern period, clothing helped establish
                                        a person's identity and located their position in a variety
                                        of categories ranging from gender, class, nationality, and
                                        religion (<ref target="#ril2003">Lublin, 10</ref>). Thus, when Lamure's
                                        clothes and goods are thrown overboard, his response is that
                                        he feels completely ruined and destroyed (i.e. "undone").
                                        Although this may seem dramatic to the modern reader, these
                                        characters experience a loss of material goods as a loss of
                                        identity. Furthermore, because Lamure is a self-made man
                                        (lines 137-140), he loses the noble identity he has created for
                                        himself (apparently by dubious means) and now fears being seen  
                                        as equal to those of a lower class that he spent
                                        "twenty years" trying to buy his way out of.</note></l>

                                        coins). According to Tibalt, Franville's most important suit

                                        monologue acts as a social commentary and revolves around
                                        how much importance noblemen gave to their material
                                        possessions, to the point where they evaluated their virtues
                                        and characters based on material goods. He begins by urging
                                        them to be grateful for having skin that is not corrupted by
                                        venereal disease ("purled with scabs"/"ancient monuments to Madam
                                        Venus"). Their skin, he continues, will never go out of fashion 
                                        or abandon them until their bodies decayed after death and were devoured by
                                        worms. The purpose of this monologue is to acquaint the
                                        audience (and readers) with how social hierarchy was
                                        determined by material possessions by having Tibalt satirize
                                        the social practice. He suggests that having clothes represent our
                                        accomplishments as individuals is just as ridiculous as fish
                                        appearing in the clothes that have now sunk to the bottom of
                                        the sea.</note></l>

                                        Descriptions of their
                                        physical state and appearance, such as "goodly long manes"

                                        not enough to indicate an exact number of years. The

                                        Greek mythology; the Golden Age was the first and best age.
                                        Iron refers to the last and worst age of mankind, signaling
                                        the transition of Albert's crew from a state of comfort and
                                        civility to a state of brutishness and toil. Also a reference
